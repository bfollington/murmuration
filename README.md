# MCP Process Management Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides background process management capabilities for AI assistants and automation workflows. This server allows Claude and other MCP-compatible AI systems to start, monitor, and manage long-running processes in a controlled environment.

## Overview

The MCP Process Management Server enables AI assistants to:

- **Start Background Processes**: Launch scripts, commands, and long-running tasks
- **Monitor Process Status**: Track running, stopped, and failed processes
- **Capture Process Output**: Stream and store stdout/stderr from managed processes  
- **Manage Process Lifecycle**: Stop, restart, and clean up processes as needed
- **Query Process Information**: List processes with filtering and search capabilities

This is particularly useful for AI-assisted development workflows where Claude needs to run build tools, development servers, tests, or other background tasks while maintaining context about their status and output.

## Features

### Current Implementation

- âœ… **Type-Safe Process Management**: Comprehensive TypeScript types for all process operations
- âœ… **Process Registry**: In-memory storage with CRUD operations for process tracking
- âœ… **State Machine**: Explicit process state transitions with validation
- âœ… **Deep Immutability**: Protection against external mutations of process data
- âœ… **Query System**: Flexible filtering, sorting, and pagination for process lists

### Planned Features

- ðŸš§ **Process Manager**: Business logic layer for process lifecycle management
- ðŸš§ **MCP Integration**: Full Model Context Protocol server implementation
- ðŸš§ **Log Streaming**: Real-time capture and streaming of process output
- ðŸš§ **Event System**: Process lifecycle events for monitoring and automation
- ðŸš§ **Web Dashboard**: Optional web interface for process monitoring
- ðŸš§ **Process Persistence**: Optional database storage for process history

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd murmuration
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Dependencies are automatically fetched by Deno
   deno cache src/main.ts
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   deno task build
   ```

## Usage

> **Note**: The MCP server implementation is currently in development. The examples below represent the planned API once implementation is complete.

### MCP Client Configuration

Add the process management server to your MCP client configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "process-manager": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": ["run", "--allow-run", "--allow-net", "--allow-read", "--allow-write", "/path/to/murmuration/src/main.ts"],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "false"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

Once implemented, the server will provide these MCP tools:

#### `start_process`
Start a new background process:
```json
{
  "script_name": "npm",
  "args": ["run", "dev"],
  "env_vars": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development",
    "PORT": "3000"
  },
  "name": "dev-server"
}
```

#### `stop_process`
Stop a running process:
```json
{
  "process_id": "uuid-process-id",
  "force": false,
  "timeout": 5000
}
```

#### `list_processes`
List and filter processes:
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "limit": 10,
  "sort_by": "startTime",
  "sort_order": "desc"
}
```

#### `get_process_logs`
Retrieve process output:
```json
{
  "process_id": "uuid-process-id",
  "limit": 100,
  "log_type": "stdout"
}
```

#### `restart_process`
Restart a stopped or failed process:
```json
{
  "process_id": "uuid-process-id"
}
```

### Example Workflows

#### Development Server Management
```typescript
// Start a development server
const devServer = await startProcess({
  script_name: "npm",
  args: ["run", "dev"],
  name: "react-dev-server"
});

// Monitor its status
const processes = await listProcesses({ status: "running" });

// View logs if issues occur
const logs = await getProcessLogs(devServer.processId, { limit: 50 });

// Stop when done
await stopProcess(devServer.processId);
```

#### Build Pipeline
```typescript
// Start build process
const build = await startProcess({
  script_name: "npm",
  args: ["run", "build"],
  name: "production-build"
});

// Start tests in parallel
const tests = await startProcess({
  script_name: "npm", 
  args: ["test"],
  name: "test-suite"
});

// Monitor both processes
const allProcesses = await listProcesses();
```

### Available Tasks

```bash
# Run the MCP server (when implemented)
deno task dev

# Build executable binary
deno task build

# Run the web interface (planned)
deno task web-dev

# Run tests
deno test

# Run tests with coverage
deno test --coverage

# Watch tests during development
deno test --watch
```

### Development Workflow

1. **Install Deno**: Ensure you have Deno 1.40+ installed
2. **Clone Repository**: Get the source code locally
3. **Run Tests**: Use `deno test` to verify everything works
4. **Make Changes**: Follow the patterns in `CLAUDE.md`
5. **Test Changes**: Write tests for new functionality
6. **Build**: Use `deno task build` to create executable

### Architecture

The project follows a layered, domain-driven design:

1. **Type Layer** (`src/shared/`, `src/process/types.ts`): Core domain types and validation
2. **Data Layer** (`src/process/registry.ts`): Process storage and CRUD operations  
3. **Business Layer** (planned: `src/process/manager.ts`): Process lifecycle management
4. **Integration Layer** (planned: `src/mcp/`): MCP protocol implementation
5. **Presentation Layer** (planned: `src/web/`): Optional web interface

### Key Design Principles

- **Type-First Development**: Define types before implementation
- **Immutable Data**: All operations return copies to prevent mutations
- **Pure Functions**: Prefer stateless functions over stateful classes
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Model the problem domain explicitly
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each layer independently and together

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
deno test

# Run specific test file
deno test src/process/registry.test.ts

# Run with coverage reporting
deno test --coverage

# Watch mode for development
deno test --watch
```

### Test Organization

- Test files use `.test.ts` suffix
- Tests are placed adjacent to source files
- Use descriptive test names that explain behavior
- Group related functionality with `Deno.test()`

### Example Test Structure

```typescript
import { assertEquals, assertThrows } from "@std/assert";
import { ProcessRegistry } from "./registry.ts";

Deno.test("ProcessRegistry - should store and retrieve processes", () => {
  const registry = new ProcessRegistry();
  const process = {
    id: "test-id",
    name: "test-process", 
    command: ["echo", "hello"],
    status: ProcessStatus.starting,
    startTime: new Date(),
    logs: [],
    metadata: {}
  };
  
  registry.addProcess(process);
  const retrieved = registry.getProcess("test-id");
  
  assertEquals(retrieved?.name, "test-process");
  assertEquals(retrieved?.command, ["echo", "hello"]);
});
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `DEBUG` | Enable debug logging | `false` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) | `info` |
| `MAX_PROCESSES` | Maximum concurrent processes | `50` |
| `LOG_BUFFER_SIZE` | Maximum log entries per process | `1000` |
| `WEB_PORT` | Web interface port (if enabled) | `8080` |

### MCP Client Configuration

For Claude Desktop, add to your configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "process-manager": {
      "command": "deno",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--allow-run",
        "--allow-net", 
        "--allow-read",
        "--allow-write",
        "/absolute/path/to/murmuration/src/main.ts"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DEBUG": "false",
        "MAX_PROCESSES": "25"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For other MCP clients, consult their documentation for server configuration.

## Process States

Processes managed by this server follow a defined state machine:

```
starting â†’ running â†’ stopping â†’ stopped
    â†“         â†“         â†“
  failed    failed    failed
```

### State Descriptions

- **starting**: Process is being spawned
- **running**: Process is active and executing
- **stopping**: Process termination has been requested
- **stopped**: Process has exited normally
- **failed**: Process encountered an error or crashed

### Valid Transitions

- `starting` â†’ `running` (spawn successful)
- `starting` â†’ `failed` (spawn failed)
- `running` â†’ `stopping` (termination requested)
- `running` â†’ `stopped` (normal exit)
- `running` â†’ `failed` (process error)
- `stopping` â†’ `stopped` (termination successful)
- `stopping` â†’ `failed` (termination failed)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Process fails to start:**
- Check that the script/command exists and is executable
- Verify environment variables are correctly set
- Review process logs for error messages
- Ensure sufficient system resources are available

**Process appears stuck in 'starting' state:**
- Check if the process requires interactive input
- Verify the command syntax is correct
- Look for permission or path issues in logs

**High memory usage:**
- Reduce `LOG_BUFFER_SIZE` to limit log retention
- Monitor process count against `MAX_PROCESSES` limit
- Check for processes that should have been cleaned up

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging for detailed information:

```bash
DEBUG=true deno task dev
```

Or set the environment variable in your MCP client configuration.

### Log Analysis

Process logs are categorized by type:
- `stdout`: Standard output from the process
- `stderr`: Error output from the process  
- `system`: Internal messages from the process manager

Use the `get_process_logs` tool to retrieve and analyze process output.
