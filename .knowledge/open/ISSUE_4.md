# Add comprehensive tests for file-based system

Create thorough tests for the file-based knowledge system to ensure reliability:

- Unit tests for all file I/O operations
- Integration tests for file manager with real files
- MCP tool testing with file backend
- Cross-reference validation tests
- Performance tests with 100+ files
- Edge cases: concurrent access, file permissions, disk full

This ensures the system is production-ready and handles all edge cases properly.
