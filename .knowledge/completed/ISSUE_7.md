# Implement file-based knowledge system

Successfully implemented a file-based knowledge management system to replace the in-memory + JSON approach.

Completed:
- ✅ Extended types to support Issue and file-based storage
- ✅ Created markdown format with YAML frontmatter
- ✅ Implemented file I/O utilities (parse, serialize, etc.)
- ✅ Built FileBasedKnowledgeManager as drop-in replacement
- ✅ Added search and listing operations
- ✅ Implemented cross-reference resolution
- ✅ Created MCP tools (record_issue, list_issues, update_issue, delete_issue)

The system is now ready for dogfooding and enables multi-agent collaboration through file-based persistence.
