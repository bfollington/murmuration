# Update CLAUDE.md for file-based knowledge

Update the CLAUDE.md documentation to reflect the new file-based knowledge system:

- Document the new MCP tools (record_issue, list_issues, update_issue, delete_issue)
- Explain the file structure (.knowledge/open/, in-progress/, etc.)
- Add examples of using the issue management system
- Explain cross-referencing with [[ISSUE_ID]] syntax
- Note that this replaces TodoWrite() for persistent task tracking

This ensures future agents understand and use the file-based system correctly.
